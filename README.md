Titanic dataset analysis project:

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic passenger dataset to discover patterns, trends, and anomalies related to passenger survival. Key steps include:

Loading and inspecting the dataset to understand features such as passenger class, age, sex, fare, family relations aboard, and embarkation port.

Using data exploration methods like .describe(), .info(), and .value_counts() to summarize data statistics and identify missing values.

Visualizing relationships through pair plots, correlation heatmaps, histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots to find trends such as survival rates by gender, class, and age.

Identifying key factors that contributed to survival using statistics and visual insights.

Gaining hands-on experience in data cleaning, feature analysis, and plotting with libraries such as pandas and seaborn.

The outcome is to build skills in uncovering insights from data, preparing it for modeling, and understanding survival factors in this historical disaster.
